Hi, I’m @RamilGirfanov
I’m currently learning Swift and iOS development. In March 2022 I completed online courses in Netology.
Here you can see my pet projects. 
Open for cooperation learning the programming language Swift, ready to take part in the development of any application for iOS in exchange for experience and knowledge. You can contact me on ramil.girfanov@gmail.com
